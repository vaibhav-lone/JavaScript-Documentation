        <h3>The Execution Context in Detail</h3>
        <p> The Global Execution Context contains:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Variable Object(VO)</li>
            <li>Scope Chain</li>
            <li>'this' Variable</li>
        </ul> 
        
        <h4>1. Creation Phase</h4>
        <ol>
            <li> Creation of VO</li>        
            <li> Creation of Scope Chain</li>        
            <li> Determin value of 'this' variable</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>2. Execution Phase</h4>
        <p>
            Code of the function that generated the current execution context is ran line by line         
        </p>
        
        <h4>A. Variable Object (VO)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> The argument object is created, containing all the arguments that were passed into the function</li>        
            <li> Code is scanned for function declarations: for each function a property is created in the Variable Object, pointing to the function</li>        
            <li> Code is scanned for variable declarations: for each variable, a property is created in the Variable Object, and set to undefined</li>
            <li> The above two key points together is called 'HOISTING'</li>
        </ul>
