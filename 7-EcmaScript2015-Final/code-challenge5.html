  <h1>Section 7: Code Challenge - 5</h1>

  <div class="steps">
    <p>Suppose that you're working in a small town administration, and you're in charge of two town elements:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Parks</li>
      <li>Streets</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It's a very small town, so right now there are only 3 parks and 4 streets. All parks and streets have a name and a build
      year.
    </p>
    <p>
      At an end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final report with the following:
      <ol>
        <li>Tree density of each park in the town (forumla: number of trees/park area)</li>
        <li>Average age of each town's park (forumla: sum of all ages/number of parks)</li>
        <li>The name of the park that has more than 1000 trees</li>
        <li>Total and average length of the town's streets</li>
        <li>Size classification of all streets: tiny/small/normal/big/huge. If the size is unknown, the default is normal</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      All the report data should be printed to the console.
      <br>

      <strong> HINT:</strong> Use some of the ES6 features: classes, subclasses, template strings, default parameters, maps, arrow
      functions, destructuring, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>
        <strong>Note:</strong> the console for result</em>
